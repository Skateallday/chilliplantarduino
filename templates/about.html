       <p>This project was started as a piece of coursework for Edinburgh Napier University's Module Ubiquitous Computing. The outline of the project was to 
        gather data from an everyday household object that could be considered useful. As chilli enuthesits, we decided to try to create a project that would
        gather the water, light, temperature and humidity levels of a chilli plant and export them into this site right here! Our expected outcome from this project 
        is a pattern of data that will show exactly that the goldielocks area for growing a plant would be.</p>

        <p>The data is generated on an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKR1000">Arduino MKR1000</a> which can connect to a WiFi signal at 2.4Ghz. This is important as the data created
        needs to be uploaded to two different services for us to use it! <a href="https://temboo.com/">Temboo</a> and <a href="https://thingspeak.com/">ThingSpeak</a> are the systems used in this project.
        Repectively they give us the ability to create Tweets when certain sections of our code are triggers and a space online to record the data we are genereating before turning them into beatiful graphics. </p>
        
        <p><a href="create.arduino.cc">Arduino Create</a> allows the use of creating apps for Arduinos online. This is helpful as it stores the code in the cloud so this project could be worked
        on from many different locations.</p>
